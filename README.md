The LINGO files included in this repository contain the optimization models used in the Dissertation entitled "Development of Inoperability Assessment and Optimization Framework for an Integrated Plastic Recycling Network". Running these models requires access to LINGO software, which may necessitate a valid license.

Modifying the Data:
The middle section of each model contains the input data, including the component units, various products, input–output ratios, baseline production capacities, minimum and maximum production capacities, substitutability binary parameters, maximum fractional substitution limits, recovery rate constants, and other relevant values. You may modify these data to adapt the model to the specific network you wish to analyze.

Modifying the Model:
The bottom section of each file contains the optimization model. A brief description is provided before each equation. You can modify these equations if you wish to further extend or improve the model.
